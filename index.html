  <p>Hi! My name is barock, and this is my blog. I’m a 16 year old high school student at Suncoast High School in Rivera Beach FL, and my interests range from math and science to economics and philosophy. <br> I decided to write this blog because I wanted a platform - a way to express myself and my ideas to the world. With this blog, I will document and discuss a wide variety of topics, hoping to build a community that can hold discourse over the content of the these topics. I will discuss philosophical issues such as ethical framework and political events, as well as scientific findings and developments. 
  <br>If you would like to send me a message or comment on the post, you can contact me on the “about” page, through the contact form.

  <p>2020 has been interesting. Politically speaking, it was even more interesting. We saw the polarization of political parties larger than ever before, with the highest turnout election we have had. Economically, we faced a terrible rescission, that was only overcome through the implementation of keynes-esque policy, prioritizing job creation and production. 2020 was not, however, as terrible of a political year as people claim it to be. Involvement in the poltical prcess and interest among teens and young adults spiked considerably, an important happening for each generation. Without educated voters and constituents, democracy cannot succeed. As socrates puts it, “There is one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance, education is the best hope for democracy.” <br>
    Although a widely recognized system, democracy has its flaws. Much like two wolfs and a sheep choosing what will be for dinner, tyranny of the majority can be a negative thing, when that majority has compromised morals. To claim that the majority is always right or just, is an ethical delusion. Take for example, the case of Nazi Germany. Maintaining a democratic system in a society without providing proper eductaion on ethical framework can lead to disturbing results. This is why I propose that we add critical thinking or ethics as a “core-course” in middle school. Simply teaching the basics of argumentation, logic and ethics can greatly improve the material conditions of the collective as a whole. <br>
    What are some of your thoughts on the issue? Send me a message on the about page!
